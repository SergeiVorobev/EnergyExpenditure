# EnergyExpenditure
Energy Expenditure for Running

This project make analysis of energy expenditure for running.

In this project I collect my personal running data with distance, elevation gain, average pace and average burned energy, made analysis of this data and calculate the equation of simple linear regression between Energy and Distance (y = 86x -9.4 + e).

Technology used: Python + numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas libraries

Method used: the Least squares regression equation

Project was created by author as part of the Systems Analysis and Decision Support Methods course at the Wroclaw University of Science and Technology
